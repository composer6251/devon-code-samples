# Music-Website
Website For Music Theory in HTML/CSS

Purpose: My own personal introduction to basic HTML5/CSS3 and Javascript. No Backend, just simple website with page navigation and text. 

How to run: No installation necessary just open the index.html in a browser once all files have been downloaded to the same directory.
